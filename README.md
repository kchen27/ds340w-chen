Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), has been an effective
approach in processing seismic data for earthquake early warning systems. This study extends the
work of Zhang et al. (2022), which developed a CNN-based model, CONIP, to predict on-site
seismic intensity using the initial seconds of waveform data. We enhance the model by integrating
data augmentation techniques, addressing the challenge of limited high-quality seismic data for
training. Our approach employs augmentation methods for seismic waveforms, enhancing the
modelâ€™s generalization and performance on unseen data. By analyzing the first few seconds of
waveform data, our improved CNN model predicts earthquake magnitudes with increased accuracy
and reliability. The study demonstrates the potential of data augmentation in overcoming data
scarcity and improving earthquake monitoring and early warning systems.
